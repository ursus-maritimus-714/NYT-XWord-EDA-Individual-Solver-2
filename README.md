# Exploratory Data Analysis of Individual Solver 2 (IS2) Performance on the New York Times Crossword Puzzle
 
 ## Introduction

### Project Overview
This summary reports on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an individual solver's (Individual Solver 2; IS2) performance over nearly 6 years (Mar. 2018 - Jan. 2024) of the [New York Times (NYT) crossword puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). Included are visual and statistical descriptions of trends in IS2 solve times across this period, IS2 performance relative to the 'Global Median Solver' (GMS; see next section), and the relationship between IS2 performance and a number of variables. These variables included properties of the puzzle grids (e.g., number of answers, number of black squares), properties of clues and answers (e.g., frequency of wordplay in clues, aggregate rarity of answers in a puzzle), environment (e.g., time of day a puzzle was completed), constructor identity, and IS2 puzzle day-of-week-specific past performance prior to a given solve. This EDA led to identification of a set of features that hold promise as useful inputs to a predictive model of IS2 future performance.

This project would not have been possible without access to two key data sources. The first, [XWord Info: New York Times Crossword Answers and Insights](https://www.xwordinfo.com/), was my source for data on the puzzles themselves. This included a number of proprietary metrics pertaining to the grids, answers, clues and constructors. XWord Info has a contract with NYT for access to the raw data underlying these metrics, but I unfortunately do not. Therefore, I will not be able to share raw or processed data that I've acquired from their site (though [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with all of my Python code for analysis and figure generation can be found [here](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Individual-Solver-2/tree/main/notebooks)). The second, [XWStats](xwstats.com), was my source for historical solve time data (for both IS2 and the GMS). 

The same analyses reported here for IS2 here were also carried out for my own (IS1) data, and are summarized [here](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Individual-Solver-1?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).

### The Global Median Solver (GMS)

Many analyses included in this summary compare IS2 performance to that of the GMS over the same set of puzzles. My extensive summary analysis of GMS performance over a 6+ year timeframe (2018-2024) can be found [here](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Global-Median-Solver?tab=readme-ov-file#readme). XWStats (Matt) determines the global median solve time (GMST) for every individual puzzle from a pool of ~1-2K individual solvers of a given puzzle for whom he has (with their consent) acquired their data from NYT. Though Matt adopted the term "global" to describe this solver sample per-puzzle, it likely skews faster than the overall population of solvers. The reasons for this assumption are twofold; only solvers who actually complete a given puzzle are included in its sample, and each sample contains only solvers motivated enough by the prospect of improvement to track their own progress to begin with. 

GMSTs improved over the full 2018-2024 period (**Figure 1**), with fairly dramatic improvement seen early on for some puzzle days and graded improvement continuing for each puzzle day until the end of the sample period (top panel). The 2-year interval density plots of raw solve time distributions (bottom panels) show that performance on individual puzzle days became more consistent over time (higher peaks with narrower distributions). Because I did not have access to the raw solver data from which the GMSTs were drawn, however, it's not possible to disentangle improvement for individual "early adopters" of Matt's tracking software versus stronger solvers joining the solver pool over time. Note also that GMS performance is tracked in my analyses by puzzle issue date, as I did not have access to GMS puzzle completion dates. It's reasonably safe to assume, however, that the GMS (a different individual solver for most puzzles, presumably) solved in approximately the sequence of puzzle issue. IS2 performance, however, is tracked by puzzle completion data since I *was* able to obtain completion timestamps for their solves with Matt's assistance.
